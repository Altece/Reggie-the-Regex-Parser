Any number of states within the NFA can be an accepting state that would signify the acceptance of a string when the string encounters its end. Transitions between states are invoked by encountering specified characters. [Learn more about NFAs from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton).\r\n\r\nThis regex parser will take a regualr expression string and create an NFA modeled by that string.\r\n\r\nA user can then take the resulting NFA and pass in a string to see if it passes the NFA.\r\n\r\nUse\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo compile and run tests, run\r\n\r\n\tmake test\r\n\r\nTo clean the build files, run\r\n\r\n\tmake clean\r\n\r\nTo clean the build files and binaries, run\r\n\r\n\tmake real-clean\r\n\r\nNFAs for Use with Parsing\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nA strict NFA would not be useful for parsing purposes. If you wanted to tokenize using an NFA, you would need to know how long the string that is accepted by the NFA is, and you would need to be able to deal with anything following the final accept terminal state.\r\n\r\nA parsing evaluator needs to be implemented to allow for the length of any accepting substring in an input string, so long as the substring and the input string start together.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
